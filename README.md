This is the week one challenge in which we are given starter code and were to change and add some content.  One of the challenges were to add accessibility to the page by including an alt attribute to an image and adding a description.  This allows text readers to read and voice the description of the image.  It will also display the description on the page if for some reason the image doesnâ€™t appear.

The title element was also changed to add a more descriptive title to reflect the nature of the website and the business behind it.  Semantic elements were also added to replace non semantic elements such as div and replacing with section.
