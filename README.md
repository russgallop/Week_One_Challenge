This is the week one challenge in which we are given starter code and were to change and add some content.

One of the challenges were to add accessibility standards.  To allow persons who are visually impaired to know what an image is on a page by using the "alt" attribute.  Or if the link becomes broken for some reason there will be a description of the image.

Also added semantic elements to replace non semantic elements such as div and replacing with section
